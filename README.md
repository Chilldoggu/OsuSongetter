# OsuSongetter
Extract audio files from osu beatmaps. Beatmaps are being downloaded from beatmap mirror [nerinyan.moe](https://nerinyan.moe/main) by using their API [Nerinyan-API](https://nerinyan.stoplight.io/docs/nerinyan-api/213e81de7af7a-nerinyan-api) (bless).

## How?
Put your beatmapset ids into `beatmapset_id.json`. You can get ids from url of osu beatmap site. Remember not to confuse beatmapset id with beatmap id.

## Why?
Because I wanted to store my favourite songs from osu locally and listen to them sometime.
