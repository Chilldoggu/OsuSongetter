# OsuSongetter
Extract audio files from osu beatmaps. Beatmaps are being downloaded from beatmap mirror [chimu.moe](https://chimu.moe/) (bless).

## How?
Put your beatmapset ids into `beatmapset_id.txt`. You can get ids from url of osu beatmap site. Remember not to confuse beatmap id with beatmapset id.

## Why?
Because I wanted to store my favourite songs from osu locally and listen to them sometime.
